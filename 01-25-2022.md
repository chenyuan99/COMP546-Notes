# The Canny Edge Detection

## Non-maximun suppression

smooth first

follow generic principles

## Fitting

### Low-level edges vs. preceived countours

*   Choose a parametric model to represent a set of features

### Issues

*   Noise

*   Extraneous data

Total least squares

Least squares: Robustness to noise

## RANSAC

### Choosing the parameters

*   Initial number of points s

*   Distance threshold t

*   Number of smaples n
